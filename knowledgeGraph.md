# Title: Scientific Knowledge Graph Builder with GPT-4 and React

Objective: Create an AI-powered tool to crawl scientific papers, extract facts, and generate a knowledge graph representing relationships between the facts. The graph should be stored in an open-source graph database and be searchable via OpenAI's GPT-4-powered semantic search. The user interface will be built using React.

## Requirements:

Web crawling and scraping library (Scrapy, Beautiful Soup)
PDF parser (PyPDF2, PDFMiner)
NLP library (spaCy, NLTK)
OpenAI GPT-4 API
Graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph)
Indexing tool (Elasticsearch, Apache Solr)
React and a visualization library (D3.js, Vis.js)
Recipe:

### Web Crawler and Scraper:
a. Use a web crawling library like Scrapy to identify scientific paper repositories.
b. Scrape the content of the papers, primarily focusing on abstracts, conclusions, and sections with key findings.
c. Parse PDFs using a PDF parser like PDFMiner to extract text content.

### Text Preprocessing:
a. Tokenize and remove stop words using an NLP library like spaCy.
b. Perform sentence segmentation to obtain individual sentences as input for GPT-4.
c. Batch the sentences as required by GPT-4 API (e.g., limit the number of tokens per request).

### Fact Extraction using GPT-4 API:
a. Send requests to the GPT-4 API for NER and Relation Extraction tasks.
b. Parse the API response to extract entities and relationships.
c. Map the extracted entities to node types (e.g., Paper, Author, Fact) and relationships to edge types (e.g., CONTAINS, WRITTEN_BY, SUPPORTS, REFUTES).

python
Copy code
Pseudocode for GPT-4 API call and fact extraction
import openai

openai.api_key = "your_api_key"

def extract_facts(text):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        prompt=f"Extract facts and relationships from the following scientific text: {text}",
        max_tokens=100,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.5,
    )

    facts = process_gpt4_response(response.choices[0].text)
    return facts
### Knowledge Graph Construction:
a. Store the extracted facts and relationships in a graph database like Neo4j.
b. Define node types (e.g., Paper, Author, Fact) and relationship types (e.g., CONTAINS, WRITTEN_BY, SUPPORTS, REFUTES).
c. Create nodes and edges in the graph database based on the extracted entities and relationships.

### Indexing:
a. Index the graph database using a tool like Elasticsearch to enable efficient searching.
b. Define relevant fields for indexing (e.g., paper title, authors, facts, relationships).

### Semantic Search with GPT-4 API:
a. Implement an AI-powered semantic search using the GPT-4 API.
b. Send the user's natural language query to the GPT-4 API to generate a graph database query.
c. Execute the generated query on the graph database and return search results ranked by relevance.

python
Copy code
Pseudocode for GPT-4 API call and semantic search
def semantic_search(query):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        prompt=f"Translate the following natural language query to a graph database query: {query}",
        max_tokens=50,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.5,
    )

    graph_query = response.choices[0].text
    search_results = execute_graph_query(graph_query)
    return search_results
### User Interface with React:
a. Set up a React application and install the required dependencies for visualization (e.g., D3.js, Vis.js).
b. Create a search bar component to input natural language queries.
c. Create a component to display search results, including facts and relationships.
d. Implement a knowledge graph visualization component using a library like D3.js or Vis.js.
e. Integrate the GPT-4 semantic search functionality into the search bar component by sending the user's query to the backend, which will call the GPT-4 API and return the search results.
f. Render the search results in the search results component.
g. Update the knowledge graph visualization component to display the extracted facts and relationships based on the search results.

javascript
Copy code
// Pseudocode for React components

// SearchBar.js
function SearchBar({ onSearch }) {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');

  const handleSearch = () => {
    onSearch(query);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleSearch}>Search</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// SearchResult.js
function SearchResult({ result }) {
  // Render the search result, e.g., a fact or relationship
}

// KnowledgeGraph.js
function KnowledgeGraph({ data }) {
  // Implement the knowledge graph visualization using D3.js or Vis.js
}

// App.js
function App() {
  const [searchResults, setSearchResults] = useState([]);

  const handleSearch = async (query) => {
    const results = await fetchSearchResults(query);
    setSearchResults(results);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <SearchBar onSearch={handleSearch} />
      <div>
        {searchResults.map(result => (
          <SearchResult key={result.id} result={result} />
        ))}
      </div>
      <KnowledgeGraph data={searchResults} />
    </div>
  );
}
With this updated recipe a highly skilled programmer should be able to implement the scientific knowledge graph builder tool.
