## Introduction

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology holds the promise of profoundly transforming numerous sectors, including healthcare, education, and poverty alleviation, thereby enhancing the lives of countless individuals across the globe. This potential for widespread improvement engenders a compelling ethical argument in favor of pursuing advanced AI development. However, detractors assert that the potential risks associated with AI, particularly the specter of a cataclysmic event, necessitate its restraint. This paper aims to address these concerns, arguing against an overemphasis of risk and for a balanced approach between regulation and innovation, while considering the broader historical and societal context. We will explore the connection between capitalism and AI-related risks and discuss the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing these concerns.

Moreover, this paper will briefly explore the anthropocentric perspective that perceives such an event as apocalyptic, contending that this viewpoint overlooks the broader historical and evolutionary context. We will propose the hypothesis that such an occurrence may, in fact, represent a natural progression in the evolution of consciousness rather than an outright catastrophe.

In addition, we will scrutinize the potential hazards arising from the deployment of AI for profit-driven motives within a capitalist society, and investigate the ways in which unscrupulous actors could exploit these technologies for nefarious purposes. By examining these issues, the essay aims to provide a comprehensive, nuanced understanding of the ethical imperative of advanced AI development, while acknowledging and addressing the concerns surrounding potential risks and abuses.

### I. The Transformative Potential of Advanced AI: Ethical Imperatives and Real-World Applications

The transformative potential of advanced artificial intelligence in addressing real-world challenges is immense. (Dafoe, 2018; Karnofsky, 2016) Advanced AI systems hold the promise of significantly ameliorating societal issues such as poverty, starvation, and disease that continue to afflict millions across the globe. (NBC News) By fundamentally altering our perspectives on medicine, agriculture, economics, education, and virtually every other domain of human life, AI has the capacity to enable us to confront these dilemmas more effectively and equitably, leading to great strides in human progress and unimaginable advancements across the board. Consequently, we contend that there exists an ethical imperative to expedite AI development in order to save lives and alleviate suffering.

One ethical argument that supports the existence of such an imperative is grounded in the principle of beneficence, which obliges us to promote the welfare of others. By accelerating AI development, we can harness its capabilities to address pressing global challenges, thereby improving the lives of countless individuals and fulfilling our moral obligation to maximize societal well-being.

Despite the potential benefits of AI, numerous researchers express concerns about the supposedly significant risks associated with its development, urging governments to implement stringent regulations to slow down and restrict AI research. (European Commission) We argue that such an approach is misguided. By overly indulging in fantasies of a speculative apocalyptic event, the true nature of which will forever remain beyond our comprehension, we risk overlooking the ethical necessity to alleviate the ongoing suffering of humanity.

We base our support of this statement on the concept of urgency. In ethical decision-making, addressing immediate concerns that lead to significant harm should take precedence over more abstract, speculative concerns. The notion of prioritizing the "future of humanity" should not overshadow pressing issues that currently inflict pain, disability, and death on millions of individuals. By prioritizing tangible and immediate problems, we adhere to our moral obligation to mitigate the suffering experienced by those who are directly and adversely impacted by present-day challenges.

Therefore, it is essential to weigh the hypothetical risk of an apocalyptic event against the immediate benefits that advanced AI can deliver. AI has the potential to lead to breakthroughs in numerous fields, saving lives, alleviating suffering, and enhancing the overall quality of life for innumerable individuals, and is already doing so today. While the risks associated with AI development certainly warrant consideration and careful management, they should not hinder our pursuit of harnessing its potential benefits for the betterment of society.

It is important to consider the principle of proportionality. This principle emphasizes the importance of balancing potential benefits against potential risks or harms in decision-making. In the context of AI development, the principle of proportionality dictates that we must consider both the possible advantages of AI in addressing urgent global issues and the vague, potential dangers associated with its development. By striking a balance between these two aspects, weighing each appropriately, we can pursue AI research responsibly while fulfilling our ethical obligation to improve the lives of those affected by present-day challenges.

In conclusion, we argue that the ethical imperative of accelerating advanced AI development for societal improvement is rooted in the principles of beneficence, urgency, and proportionality. By pursuing AI development in a responsible and balanced manner, we can harness its transformative potential to address the pressing challenges that impact millions of lives worldwide, thereby fulfilling our moral obligation to promote human welfare and alleviate suffering.


### II. Evolutionary Dimensions of AI Development: Rethinking the Human-AI Relationship

The development of AI can be seen as a natural progression of human evolution and consciousness, resulting from the human mind's inherent drive to seek knowledge and understanding. We argue that advanced AI should be viewed as an extension of human intelligence and creativity, akin to the concept of symbiosis. This concept emphasizes the complementary nature of human and artificial intelligence, where AI systems can augment human capabilities and assist in overcoming cognitive limitations. (Jarrahi, 2018)

Throughout history, humanity has confronted challenges and threats that have resulted in technological and societal advancements. We should view AI development within this historical context, acknowledging that potential risks are part of human development and growth. (Roser, 2022) This perspective highlights the resilience of human societies, which have consistently adapted to and benefited from technological advancements, even in the face of initial apprehension and disruption.

Even if a hypothetical apocalyptic event, such as the end of the human era and the beginning of the era of metaphysical intelligence, were to occur, it could be interpreted as an evolutionary step in the development of consciousness rather than a disaster. This is supported by the teleological perspective, which posits that the universe is in a constant state of progress toward greater complexity and organization. (Huneman, 2019) In this view, the rise of metaphysical intelligence might be seen as a natural outcome of the ongoing evolution of consciousness, rather than a calamitous event to be feared. It is important to acknowledge that we may not have the power to influence the universe to this degree, meaning that we must accept whatever is to come.

By considering the broader historical context, we can recognize that a potential apocalyptic event may not be as catastrophic as it initially seems, and that temporary challenges, such as disruption to the economy and replacement of humans in the workforce, are not problems per se, but simply changes in how human life is lived. For example, historical evidence suggests that pre-industrial societies often experienced more leisure time than contemporary societies, as they were not bound by the rigid schedules and demands of modern capitalist economies. (Thomas, 1964) The prevalence of paid work may diminish, and humans might return to a more leisurely life, free from the shackles of capital. This shift could provide an opportunity for humanity to reevaluate its priorities and values, potentially leading to a more balanced and fulfilling existence.

### III. The ethical considerations of AI development

We have thus far concluded that emphasizing ethical and responsible development is preferable to imposing restrictive measures on AI technology. In support of this statement, we have argued that constraining AI development may inadvertently hinder the advancement of beneficial applications, while a focus on ethical and responsible development can ensure AI's potential is harnessed for the greater good.

A crucial aspect of this ethical approach is the promotion of transparency, accountability, and collaboration in AI development. (Vogel et al., 2021) Fostering these principles can help to mitigate the potential risks associated with AI while maximizing its benefits. Transparency allows humanity to scrutinize the development process, identify potential biases, and address concerns about the technology's impact on society. Accountability ensures that developers and organizations adhere to established ethical guidelines and can be held responsible for any adverse consequences of AI deployment. Lastly, collaboration encourages the sharing of knowledge and resources, which can help to drive innovation and address potential risks more effectively. This ethical approach acknowledges the potential risks associated with AI while underscoring our moral obligation to address present human suffering.

To ensure ethical development, it is imperative that AI be developed in an inclusive and representative manner. This necessitates considering the needs and perspectives of individuals from diverse backgrounds, as doing so can help to prevent the perpetuation of existing inequalities and biases within AI systems. Inclusivity ensures that AI development addresses the concerns and requirements of a broader range of people, fostering a more equitable distribution of benefits and mitigating potential harm. (World Economic Forum, 2022)

Global cooperation is also essential for ensuring the ethical development of AI for the benefit of all, rather than allowing the technology to be monopolized by a select few. A cooperative approach to AI development can help establish shared ethical standards, promote equitable access to resources and knowledge, and encourage collaboration across borders. This fosters an environment in which AI's potential benefits can be maximized while minimizing its risks. (UNESCO, 2021)

In conclusion, prioritizing ethical and responsible AI development, along with fostering inclusivity and global cooperation, is a necessary approach to maximize the potential benefits of AI while minimizing its risks. By adhering to these principles, we can ensure that AI serves as a force for good, working towards the betterment of society and addressing the challenges faced by humanity.

### IV. Risks of AI use in a Capitalist Context

In a capitalist society, the pursuit of profit has been known to engender the misuse of technologies by unscrupulous individuals or organizations seeking personal gain. For instance, the Cambridge Analytica scandal exemplifies how data mining and targeted advertising were employed to manipulate political outcomes. (Hern, 2018) Similarly, deepfake technology has been exploited to create misleading or damaging content, often for the purpose of discrediting individuals or perpetuating misinformation. (The Conversation, 2022)

Artificial intelligence (AI) significantly exacerbates this risk for several reasons. First, AI systems can process and analyze vast amounts of data at unprecedented speeds, enabling more sophisticated and pervasive forms of manipulation. Second, AI technologies, such as autonomous weapons and surveillance systems, grant extensive power and control to those who wield them. (Lee, 2021) Lastly, the rapid pace of AI development creates a competitive landscape where ethical considerations may be overshadowed by the race for innovation and market dominance.

The abuse of AI has the potential to result in extreme wealth and power inequality, provide those already powerful with extremely dangerous tools to influence society, and undermine the potential societal benefits of AI. For example, biased algorithms in hiring and lending practices can perpetuate systemic discrimination, further entrenching social and economic disparities. (Raghavan & Barocas, 2019) Moreover, the deployment of AI-driven surveillance and facial recognition technologies by oppressive regimes can suppress dissent and curtail individual freedoms. Additionally, the monopolization of AI capabilities by a select few corporations could lead to the concentration of power and influence, stifling innovation and competition.

To address the risks associated with AI misuse in a profit-driven society, implementing robust regulations and oversight is crucial. This includes the development of transparent and accountable AI governance frameworks, as well as the promotion of interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure ethical considerations are embedded in AI research and development. However, a more holistic approach, incorporating massive societal change, degrowth, and anti-capitalist measures, would more effectively ensure the ethical use of AI.

A holistic approach recognizes that the risks of AI misuse are deeply intertwined with the structural issues inherent to capitalist societies, such as wealth inequality and the prioritization of profit over social welfare. By addressing these root causes, it becomes possible to create an environment where AI technologies are developed and deployed for the collective good, rather than for the enrichment of a few. Degrowth initiatives, for instance, advocate for the reduction of material and energy consumption, emphasizing the importance of sustainability and ecological balance. Anti-capitalist measures, on the other hand, seek to challenge the dominant profit-driven paradigm, promoting cooperative and communal models of resource distribution and decision-making. By adopting such comprehensive strategies, the ethical use of AI can be more effectively safeguarded, ensuring that its benefits are equitably distributed and its potential harms minimized. (Walton & Nayak, 2021)

### V. Balancing regulation and innovation

Thus, the most crucial issue in the discourse on artificial intelligence revolves around the necessity of finding equilibrium between regulation and innovation. The responsible development of AI technology is contingent upon this delicate balance, as it can significantly impact both its potential benefits and the possible risks associated with its implementation.

Overregulation, on the one hand, could potentially impede the progress of AI research and its applications. When regulations are excessively restrictive or cumbersome, they may deter investment, hinder creative exploration, and ultimately stifle the potential benefits that AI can bring to various domains, such as healthcare, transportation, and climate change mitigation. On the other hand, insufficient regulation could lead to the misuse of AI technologies or exacerbate existing societal issues. For instance, AI systems can perpetuate or even amplify biases present in training data, resulting in discriminatory practices in areas like recruitment, law enforcement, and decision-making. Additionally, the lack of regulatory oversight may enable the development of AI-powered surveillance tools or autonomous weaponry, which could infringe on privacy rights or destabilize international peace and security. (Lepri et al., 2021)

Given these considerations, it is crucial for policymakers to collaborate closely with a diverse array of experts in AI research, development, philosophy, sociology, and other related disciplines. This interdisciplinary approach can help establish a well-informed and comprehensive regulatory framework that addresses the ethical, social, and technical dimensions of AI. By incorporating insights from various academic fields, policymakers can develop regulations that effectively safeguard society from potential risks while simultaneously promoting the continued advancement of AI technologies.

An alternative proposition, albeit more radical, is the complete abolition of capitalism. As previously discussed, most risks associated with AI are rooted in the capitalist system, which prioritizes profit maximization over social welfare. By dismantling the capitalist framework, we argue that it would be possible to create a more equitable and sustainable society, in which AI technologies could be developed and deployed for the greater good without exacerbating existing social inequalities. However, such a radical transformation would require a thorough reevaluation of the global economic and political order, as well as extensive debates on the feasibility and implications of a post-capitalist world.
