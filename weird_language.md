## 1. Introduction
Constructed languages have long captured the imagination of linguists, writers, and learners alike. Simplexum is a newly developed constructed language that aims to provide a gender-neutral, simple, and easy-to-learn means of communication. This paper outlines the basic structure, grammar, and vocabulary of Simplexum, and provides examples of the language in use.

## 2. Linguistic Structure
Simplexum is an agglutinative language that relies on the combination of basic roots to create compound words. The language features a simple phonetic inventory with a limited number of vowels and consonants, which aids in pronunciation and learning.

## 3. Grammar
Simplexum grammar is designed to be straightforward and intuitive. The language employs subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, similar to English. Simplexum uses affixes to indicate tense, mood, and aspect, with minimal irregularities. Additionally, Simplexum has no grammatical gender, making the language more inclusive and easier to learn.

### 3.1 Tense
To indicate tense, Simplexum uses prefixes:
- Past tense: add "pa-" to the verb
- Present tense: no prefix
- Future tense: add "fu-" to the verb

### 3.2 Plurality
Simplexum uses the suffix "-s" to indicate plurality, similar to English. The suffix is added to the noun to indicate more than one of the entity.

### 3.3 Pronouns
Simplexum has a set of gender-neutral pronouns, simplifying communication and making the language more inclusive:
- mi: I, me
- tu: you
- lu: he, she, they (singular)
- nos: we, us
- vos: you (plural)
- los: they (plural)

## 4. Vocabulary
The Simplexum vocabulary is built upon a set of 100 basic roots, which can be combined to form compound words. This allows for the expression of a wide range of concepts while maintaining a minimalistic lexicon.
